# C360 APIs for Postman

The current [Postman](https://www.postman.com) collection of consists of 11 requests for the following Salesforce C360 APIs:

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <ul>
            <li>Profile API</li>
            <li>Query API</li>
            <li>Calculated Insights API</li>
            <li>Metadata</li>
         </ul>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

As new APIs are made available to the C360, the collection will be expanded to include those.

## Installation

This collection currently only supports the **Postman desktop app** to connect to C360 with the Salesforce C360 APIs collection. 

- [Install the Collection](install-the-collection.md)

We are evaluating the changes required to support the **Postman web app** as an alternative approch.
